# Shrink JSON files

In order to push our data source into GitHub we have to shrink the JSON files up to 200 rows per file.

We based our analysis on the 192000 rows from the original review.json file.

The original data can be downloaded from [Yelp Academy Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download)

Please feel free to ask any question about this dataset.
